# AttentionSmelling ‚Äî Using Large Language Models to Identify Code Smells

## üìÑ Paper
The research paper for this project is available in the `artifact` folder:

- [paper.pdf](./artifact/paper.pdf)

## üíæ Storage Requirements & Legal Disclaimers
This project may require significant storage space, depending on the dataset and model interactions.

### Ethical and Legal Statements
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Files

Within the project directory, you'll find several important folders and files related to the research and experiment:

- **`artifact/`**: Contains the main experiment code, the research paper, and all other folders related to the project, including:
  - `main.ipynb`: This notebook holds the complete code responsible for the experiment discussed in the research paper.
  - `ground_truth/`: Contains the analyzed code smells used in the research.
  - `research_questions/`: This folder includes the results obtained for each code smell analyzed in the research.
  - `plots/`: Contains the generated graphs and visualizations related to the results.

## üìã Requirements

- **Python version**: >= 3.10
- **Dependencies**: Listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which can be installed using `pip`.
- **Storage**: This project requires significant storage space for datasets and generated models.
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows should work, but ensure that your system meets the hardware and software requirements.
- **Additional Software**: None, but the project uses OpenAI's API, so you'll need access to their platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (inside `artifact` folder):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Execute

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

2. Open the `.env` file and set your OpenAI API token:
   ```
   OPENAI_TOKEN=your_openai_token_here
   ```

   You can obtain a valid token by subscribing to OpenAI's services here:
   üëâ [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/payment-methods)

3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook.

   - Open `main.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).
   - Run each cell in sequence.

‚úÖ **Expected Output**: The script should run without errors, and you should see the analysis and results being printed in the notebook.
